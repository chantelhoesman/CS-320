How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
You can make sure your code is secure by following the best coding practices. Start all projects from a security mindset. Test early and often.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
You should engage with users asking follow up and probing questions to get the best understanding of their needs. You can also ask for anecdotes on what they 
feel are somethings they would like to see. After you are ready you can ask users for feedback during the process to make sure that you understand one another. 
How do I approach designing software?
I start with functionality. Once it is functional I refractor in style. I like to code out the bones of the project and then go in and fill out each section.
